<p>Abraham Benjamin "AB" de Villiers is a South African cricketer who captains the South African Test and One Day International (ODI) teams, and is regarded as the best batsman in the world at present and one of the best of all time.He holds many batting records, such as the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in ODI cricket, the fastest Test century by a South African and the fastest T20I 50 by a South African.As of 2016, he has passed 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and has a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.He is popular all over the world for his Unorthodox Cricket shots

</p>
<p>  When on song, de Villiers can take any bowling apart with his wide array of strokes on either side of the wicket. If his drives, pulls and cuts are pleasing to the eye, his ability to innovate has left bowlers hapless on many occasions.  </p>
 <p>Most of the ODI innings played by the master batsman, would be full of believe-it-or-not innovative shots, be it the ramp over the wicket-keeper, the cheeky paddles past short fine or the audacious reverse sweeps and reverse pulls while facing up to quick bowlers. Unquestionably, with his ability to manoeuvre the field placements and his excellent hand-eye co-ordination, de Villiers has turned out to be one of the most exciting batsmen across all formats of the game. </p>
